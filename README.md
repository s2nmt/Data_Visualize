# Process, analyze and visualize weather data using Python

## Introduction 
This project is used to visualize data with Python. It applies PyQt5 to design the interface and uses a timer to update real-time data from Google Sheets.

The project involves analyzing weather data in Vietnam from 1900 to 2015. I used an ESP8266 to read data from a DHT11 sensor and insert it into Google Sheets. I used a Python timer to read the data in real-time from Google Sheets and continuously visualize it.

The first chart shows monthly rainfall and temperature in 2015, using a combined bar and area chart.
